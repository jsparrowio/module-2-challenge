UofM/edX Coding Bootcamp - Challenge 2

## Description

This was the second challenge we will complete for the UofM/edX Full Stack Flex Coding Bootcamp. It was completed to practice our skills with writing an HTML page from scratch using pre-determined CSS classes. Additionally, it was used to ensure we wrote proper semantic and non-semantic elements. It was also used to ensure we wrote the classes in the proper order, with the right elements. Lastly, it was used to practice some advanced CSS properties such as media queries and background images.

Beyond the actual assignment, this project will be used to deploy an anctual portfolio for the UoM Coding Bootcamp work, which will continue to be udpated as the course progresses.

## Usage

The main use of this project will be to display and distribute the work that is complete in the UoM Coding Bootcamp by Josh Garrett.
